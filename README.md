# cruddyAuthBlog

This is a simple app to demonstrate how to execute CRUD operations with <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/synopsis.html">Node.js</a> + <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> + <a href="http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html">Express.js</a> + <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html">Mongoose.js</a> + <a href="http://passportjs.org/docs/overview">Passport.js</a>

If you do not have <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (Mac package manager) installed then install it with the following command in your terminal:
    `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

If you don't have Node.js or MongoDB installed, once you have installed Homebrew install them with the following commands in your terminal: 
    `brew install node`
    `brew install mongodb`

Run the command "mongod" in one terminal window to start running a local instance of MongoDB, then in another terminal window, after you have navigated to inside this cloned git repo, run `npm start`, then visit "localhost:3000" in your browser.
