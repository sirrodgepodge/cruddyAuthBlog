# cruddyAuthBlog

This is a simple app to demonstrate how to execute CRUD operations with Node.js + MongoDB + Express.js + Mongoose.js + Passport.js

If you don't have Node.js or MongoDB installed, install them with <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>: 
  "brew install node"
  "brew install mongodb"

Run the command "mongod" in one terminal window to start running a local instance of MongoDB, then "npm start" from inside this app's folder and visit "localhost:3000" (if you've changed the port inside of the ".env" file then replace "3000" with your specified port)
