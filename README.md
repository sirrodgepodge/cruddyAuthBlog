# cruddyAuthBlog

This is a simple app to demonstrate how to execute CRUD operations with <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/synopsis.html">Node.js</a> + <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> + <a href="http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html">Express.js</a> + <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html">Mongoose.js</a> + <a href="http://passportjs.org/docs/overview">Passport.js</a>

If you don't have Node.js or MongoDB installed, install them with <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>: 
  "brew install node"
  "brew install mongodb"

Run the command "mongod" in one terminal window to start running a local instance of MongoDB, then "npm start" from inside this app's folder and visit "localhost:3000" (if you've changed the port inside of the ".env" file then replace "3000" with your specified port)

The app uses jQuery on the front end as back end is the focus so I wanted to make the front end understood by all javascript devs.
