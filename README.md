This is a simple app to demonstrate how to execute CRUD operations with Node.js + MongoDB + Express.js + Mongoose.js + Passport.js

If you don't have Node.js or MongoDB installed, install them with Homebrew: 
"brew install node"
"brew install mongodb"

Run "mongod" in one window (if you don't have MongoDB instal) then "npm start" from inside this folder
